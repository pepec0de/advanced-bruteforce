First project in python!
I called it Brinduska. I have made this tool as I dont find any tool that could make a bruteforce attack with input parameters, like the http-forms and methods for any web. The only one was Hydra but I found it a pain to use.
So, I decided to create this simple tool with a simple lang.
It doesn't have proxy support yet cause I'm still working on it.
